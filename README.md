# Indian-Food-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning
I have created the Model using the method of transfer learning.
The model used is Google's EfficientNet.
Efficientnet_b0 = "https://tfhub.dev/google/efficientnet/b0/classification/1"
There are nearly 80 different categories of Indian Food trained.
After inputing an image you get its name as well as the calorie count.

The model has an accuracy of around 55 to 60 percent but if the image is clear enough, then the error rate is quite less.

Anvil Has been used to create a webapp.
